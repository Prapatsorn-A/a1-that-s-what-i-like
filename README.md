# Word2Vec and GloVe Models with Flask Web App

This project demonstrates the use of Word2Vec and GloVe embeddings for natural language processing tasks such as word analogies and word similarity. A Flask web application is used to provide an interface to interact with the models.

## Files Overview

- `README.md`: This file, containing documentation on how to use the project.
- `requirements.txt`: Contains the necessary Python packages required for the project.
- `app.py`: The main Flask web application to run the model and display results.
- `A1.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook used for training the models and running various tasks (e.g., word analogies, similarity).
- `templates/index.html`: HTML file for the Flask app’s front-end.
- `glove.6B.100d.txt`: Pre-trained GloVe embeddings used in the notebook for training.
- `skipgram_model.pth`: A saved model file from the notebook for Word2Vec.
- `word2index.pkl`: A pickle file containing a mapping from words to indices used by the model.
- `word-test.v1.txt`: File used for word analogy tasks in the notebook.
- `wordsim_similarity_goldstandard.txt`: File used for word similarity tasks in the notebook.
- `Report on Word2Vec and GloVe Models.pdf`: A report that describes the tasks and models used in the project.
